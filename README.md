# CS50P 2022 Course `By David J. Malan`

---

These are codes that I've written and submitted to [***CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python***](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). 

The course gave access to a platform in conjunction with CodeSpaces and GitHub, enabling the students to code, check and submit files easily and via browser. 

---

Throughout the making of these files I'm rushing to do things, trying to submit the answers as soon as possible.

The files may not be well commented and alike because: 
- a. I'm in such a hurry that I forgot to comment something important; or
- b. I don't find the comment relevant to the matter.

Since I've already started my ['challenge'](https://github.com/TDPessoa/my_python_challenge_2022), I'll include these files as well.

Keeping in mind that it will require new comments and explanations differing from the actual.

If, in the future, I acknowledge that new comments are needed or old ones must be re-phrased, I'll return to this directory and create a final commit afterwards.
